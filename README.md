# 🐤 Flappy Bird Clone
#### I felt like I needed to make simpler games to really learn the fundamentals of the Unity Engine so I remade the once-popular flappy bird game.
- An almost perfect clone of the game.
- It seems I adjusted the flap height a little too high and made the game significantly harder than the original. I could simply change the variable on the editor but where is the fun in that.

## ✅ Possible Improvements
- Add high score screen after death
- Use local storage to store high score

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Unity 2021.3.4f1
